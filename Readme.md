## another desktop pet (WIP!) 

so, this is a modern solution to desktop pets / reinventation of oneko, but instead of being only a few characters, you can customize it by putting the sprites you want!
#### made in sfml 3, c++ and with love!

## TO-DO:
- [ ] finish the first version, currently focusing on windows
- [ ] Full linux support
- [ ] Dialogs system
- [ ] window borders interaction system
- [ ] optimizing
- [ ] make a wiki / documentation
- [ ] take in account your ideas!

## Usage 
  this is the current wip usage of the app
  

  ```NADP.exe pet_name speed scale```
  example on widows powershell:
    ```.\NADP.exe oneko 5 0.5```

    

## Missing features / current wip features
- ~~move the pet to the cursor, and updating the sprites properly~~
